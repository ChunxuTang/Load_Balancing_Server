<a id="include-three-projects" class="anchor" href="#include-three-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Include three projects:</h2>

<p>(1) Client Manager Design<br>
Implement three different kinds of clients (multi-process client, multi-thread client with lock, multi-thread client without lock), and test with a simple server.  </p>

<p>(2) Server Design<br>
Implement a multi-process server, which can pre-fork a user-defined number of children to handle requests from clients. If the simultaneous requests are more than number of pre-forked children, it can fork some more children to handle requests. The maximum number of children can be forked is also user-defined. And there is a time-out, that if a new child does not have work more than the time-out, it will be removed. The server is tested by a client manager.  </p>

<p>(3) Load Balancing Server Design<br>
The core of this whole project. Implement a load balancing server which can balance loads on different real servers. It receives request from a client, sends it to a specific server according to the specific scheduling algorithm. The real sever is similar to the server designed in part 2. After a real server handles this request, the load balancing server will receive response from the real server and send it back to the client. There is also a heartbeat mechanism between load balancing server and real servers to ensure real servers are "healthy".  </p>

<a id="how-to-run-the-programs" class="anchor" href="#how-to-run-the-programs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Run the Programs</h2>

<p>The programs run on Linux exclusively, and have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, 32-bit.<br>
Change current directory to Load Balancing Server directory.</p>

<pre><code>cd Load_Balancing_Server
</code></pre>

<p>And then, type</p>

<pre><code>sudo make all
</code></pre>

<p>In Server and Load Balancer directories, there will be two versions of executable files: debug and release. The debug version can provide more debugging messages of the programs and may run a little bit slower. The release version can directly be used and provide less debugging information.<br>
In ClientManger directory, there will only be executable files that can be directly used.</p>
