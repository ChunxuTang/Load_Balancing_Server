{"name":"Load Balancing Server","tagline":"","body":"Load-Balancing-Server\r\n=====================\r\n\r\n\r\n## Include three projects:\r\n\r\n(1) Client Manager Design  \r\nImplement three different kinds of clients (multi-process client, multi-thread client with lock, multi-thread client without lock), and test with a simple server.  \r\n\r\n(2) Server Design  \r\nImplement a multi-process server, which can pre-fork a user-defined number of children to handle requests from clients. If the simultaneous requests are more than number of pre-forked children, it can fork some more children to handle requests. The maximum number of children can be forked is also user-defined. And there is a time-out, that if a new child does not have work more than the time-out, it will be removed. The server is tested by a client manager.  \r\n\r\n(3) Load Balancing Server Design  \r\nThe core of this whole project. Implement a load balancing server which can balance loads on different real servers. It receives request from a client, sends it to a specific server according to the specific scheduling algorithm. The real sever is similar to the server designed in part 2. After a real server handles this request, the load balancing server will receive response from the real server and send it back to the client. There is also a heartbeat mechanism between load balancing server and real servers to ensure real servers are \"healthy\".  \r\n\r\n## How to Run the Programs\r\n\r\nThe programs run on Linux exclusively, and have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, 32-bit.  \r\nChange current directory to Load Balancing Server directory.\r\n\r\n    cd Load_Balancing_Server\r\n\r\nAnd then, type\r\n\r\n    sudo make all\r\n\r\nIn Server and Load Balancer directories, there will be two versions of executable files: debug and release. The debug version can provide more debugging messages of the programs and may run a little bit slower. The release version can directly be used and provide less debugging information.  \r\nIn ClientManger directory, there will only be executable files that can be directly used.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
